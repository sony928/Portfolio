I’m currently gaining valuable experience through my internships, and my passion for AI continues to grow every day. It’s truly exciting to explore how AI can enhance user experiences across various domains. Whether it's making applications smarter or providing personalized recommendations, AI offers immense potential to improve the way we interact with technology.

I have strong technical skills in React, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I actively apply in my projects to build dynamic and user-friendly applications. These skills allow me to create seamless frontend experiences and robust backend architectures that drive the functionality of modern web applications.

One of my favorite projects is an AI Quiz App, where I integrated intelligent features to make learning interactive and engaging. The app adapts to the user's learning pace and preferences, offering real-time feedback and suggestions for improvement. I’m also working on an AI-driven chat app, which helps users navigate through a variety of tasks in a conversational manner.

Currently, I’m focused on developing a basic e-commerce website where my vision is to integrate AI functionalities that enhance the shopping experience, such as:

AI-powered product suggestions: Personalized recommendations based on user preferences, past behavior, and browsing patterns.

Speech-to-text features: A more accessible and hands-free way for users to interact with the platform, making it easier for everyone to search and browse products.

3D product showcases: An immersive, interactive 3D view of products, helping users make more informed purchasing decisions by visualizing the items in detail.

Additionally, I’m exploring AI-driven dynamic pricing models that adjust the pricing of products based on demand, stock availability, and user behavior, ensuring a fair and competitive shopping environment.

My ultimate goal is to leverage AI explicitly in all aspects of my projects, ensuring they stand out and deliver exceptional value. By integrating AI in both backend and frontend systems, I aim to make every interaction smarter, more efficient, and more enjoyable for users. Currently, I’m actively working on an AI-powered e-commerce website, where I’m incorporating these cutting-edge technologies to bring my ideas to life and provide a next-level user experience.

I’m also continuously learning and experimenting with new AI and machine learning techniques to further enhance my projects. Whether it's deep learning, NLP, or computer vision, I’m excited to explore and apply AI in every domain of web development.
